Here’s a structured project proposal for your Cab Booking system in Java using OOP concepts:


---

1. Project Title

SmartCab: An Object-Oriented Cab Booking System


---

2. Project Description

Purpose:
The project aims to develop a simple yet efficient cab booking system where users can book cabs based on their location, preferences, and availability.

Problem it Solves:
Manual booking processes or inefficient cab systems cause delays and poor customer service. This project offers a digital, streamlined alternative.

Importance of OOP Concepts:
OOP allows for better organization, code reusability, and easy maintenance. It helps model real-world entities like Cabs, Users, and Bookings effectively.


---

3. Project Objectives

Main Goals:

To design a cab booking system using Java and OOP principles.

To simulate user-cab interactions.

To provide a menu-driven interface for ease of use.


Key Functionalities:

User registration and login.

Booking a cab based on location and type.

Viewing booking history.

Admin dashboard to manage cabs and bookings.



---

5. Technology Stack

Programming Language: Java

Frameworks/Libraries: Java Collections, Java Swing (optional for GUI), or console-based UI

Database: File handling or MySQL (if persistence is needed)



---

6. Use of OOP Principles

Encapsulation:

All data (e.g., user info, cab details) will be private.

Access via public getters and setters.


Inheritance:

Cab could be a superclass, with StandardCab, LuxuryCab, etc., as subclasses.

Users could be Admin and Customer, inheriting from a base User class.


Polymorphism:

Method Overloading for booking cabs (e.g., by location or type).

Method Overriding for different cab pricing models.


Abstraction:

Abstract classes or interfaces for common actions like booking, canceling, or payment.

8. Final Outcome and Usefulness

Outcome:
A working cab booking system that simulates real-time cab bookings, user management, and ride history.

Usefulness:

Helps understand and apply OOP concepts practically.

Could be extended into a real-world application with further development.

Offers hands-on experience in problem-solving and system design.



---

9. Conclusion

This project will provide a strong foundation in object-oriented programming through a real-life problem — cab booking. It not only helps in understanding theory but also improves design thinking, modularity, and reusability.
