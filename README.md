Here's a detailed explanation of a Cab Booking System Java project. This is a typical beginner-to-intermediate level project that helps you understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling or database use, and basic Java concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and collections.

Project Title: Cab Booking System in Java


---

Objective:

To create a simple console or GUI-based application that allows users to book a cab, calculate fare, track rides, and manage drivers and users.


---

Modules of the Project:

1. User Module

Features:

Register/Login

Book a cab

View booking history

Cancel booking



2. Driver Module

Features:

Add new drivers

Update availability

View assigned rides

Accept/decline ride



3. Admin Module

Features:

View all users and drivers

Manage bookings

View reports/statistics



4. Booking Module

Features:

Search for available cabs

Calculate fare based on distance and time

Assign nearest driver

Generate booking ID




---

Technologies Used:

Language: Java

Optional GUI: Java Swing/JavaFX or just use Console-based

Database: MySQL / or file handling using .txt or .csv



---

Core Java Concepts Used:

Classes and Objects: For Users, Drivers, Bookings

Inheritance: Admin, User, and Driver might inherit from a common Person class

Polymorphism: Method overriding for fare calculation (e.g., different cab types)

Encapsulation: Private data with getters/setters

Collections: ArrayList, HashMap to store data in memory

Exception Handling: To handle invalid inputs, booking errors

File I/O or JDBC: To store and retrieve user and booking data



---

Sample Classes:

1. User Class

public class User {
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private String phone;

    public void bookCab(String pickup, String drop) {
        // logic for booking
    }

    public void cancelBooking(String bookingId) {
        // logic to cancel
    }
}

2. Driver Class

public class Driver {
    private String driverId;
    private String name;
    private boolean available;

    public void acceptRide(String bookingId) {
        // accept ride
    }
}

3. Booking Class

public class Booking {
    private String bookingId;
    private User user;
    private Driver driver;
    private double fare;
    private String pickupLocation;
    private String dropLocation;

    public double calculateFare(int distance) {
        return distance * 10.0; // example fare calculation
    }
}


---

How the Booking Works (Logic Flow):

1. User logs in and requests a ride.


2. System checks for available drivers near pickup location.


3. Calculates fare based on distance.


4. Assigns a driver and creates a booking.


5. Driver gets notification and accepts/rejects.


6. Updates the booking status.




---

Optional Features:

Add map API for real-time location (advanced)

Use GUI with Swing or JavaFX

Payment module

Email/SMS notification simulation
